Saint Paul was originally named Pig's Eye or Pig's Eye Landing. Its name was changed to Saint Paul by a Catholic priest who had just built
a log cabin church. Pig's Eye was the nickname of a Pierre Parrant, a one-eyed squatter who ran a still out of a cave in the river bluff. He had been squatting close to FortSnelling for a time, but was evicted and moved downstream a few miles.
